* \[April 2024\]  I will talk about the covariation between forest age shifts and the net carbon balance at the [*European Geosciences Union*](https://www.egu24.eu/) in the [Present and future global vegetation dynamics and carbon stocks from observations and models](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/session/49947) session. The abstract can be found [here](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-3888.html).
