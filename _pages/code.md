## Emulating Ecological Memory with Recurrent Neural Networks

[Code](https://github.com/bask0/dl4es_ch18) on github

With [Basil Kraft](http://mcarvalho.ml/) and [Sujan Koiral](), we developped an deep learning emulator to provide an insight into the relevance of memory effects in the Earth system and presents an experimental case study to use an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to emulate a physical model. We demonstrate that an RNN is largely capable of learning the memory effects encoded in a physical model. A non-temporal fully connected model cannot reproduce such memory effects, especially during anomalous conditions (e.g. climate extremes).
