My current resarch activities include:

## Global covariation of forest age distribution shifts with the net carbon balance
![Global covariation of forest age distribution shifts with the net carbon balance]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fig3a.png){: .align-left width="50%"}
In this research project, I focuss on understanding the relationship between forest age and net carbon balance, essential for effective forest management and climate change mitigation. Using the Global Age Mapping Integration (GAMI) v1.0 dataset, I investigate changes in global forest age from 2010 to 2020 and their correlation with carbon stock changes and net CO2 fluxes.

## Deep-learning emulator for Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L1B waveforms using sentinel data
![Deep-learning emulator for GEDI L1B waveforms using Sentinel data]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fig4.png){: .align-left width="50%"}
This project involves developing a deep-learning-based emulator for GEDI  L1B waveforms, utilizing Sentinel satellite and climate data. This innovative approach aims to simulate GEDI waveform data, which are critical for understanding forest structure and biomass. By leveraging the extensive coverage and high-resolution imagery from Sentinel satellites, we can enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of GEDI data emulation.
