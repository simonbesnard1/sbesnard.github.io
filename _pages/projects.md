## Global covariation of forest age distribution shifts with the net carbon balance
![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fig3a.png){: .align-left} 
In this research project, I focuss on understanding the relationship between forest age and net carbon balance, essential for effective forest management and climate change mitigation. Using the Global Age Mapping Integration (GAMI) v1.0 dataset, I investigate changes in global forest age from 2010 to 2020 and their correlation with carbon stock changes and net carbon dioxide fluxes.
