My name is Simon Besnard and I am a senior researcher at the[  GFZ Helmholtz Centre Potsdam](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/sektion/fernerkundung-und-geoinformatik/themen/global-land-monitoring).
I received my PhD from[  Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/wageningen-university.html) and the[  Max Planck Insitute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en), where I was working in the[  Laboratory of Geo-information Science and Remote Sensing](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/laboratory-of-geo-information-science-and-remote-sensing.htm) and the[  Model Data Integration (MDI) group](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en/bgi/mdi) under the supervision of[  Prof. Martin Herold](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/martin.herold/sec14) and[  Dr. Nuno Carvalhais](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZVPwSIAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research**\
I aim to understand better the past, current, and future dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems and their feedback on environmental conditions. I have vast knowledge in developing and applying new methods to extract information from a large amount of data to understand better ecosystem functioning in an ongoing changing climate. My research aims to answer questions related to the role of climate and vegetation variation in shaping biogeochemical cycles. My research activities have reduced the uncertainties in estimating land-atmosphere carbon fluxes, though significant uncertainties remain. I currently focus on understanding the dynamics of forest structure changes during the last decade and providing evidence for the co-variation between the carbon cycle and forest dynamics. 

**Studies**\
My journey kicked off with a BSc in Environmental Sciences from the University of Rennes 1 in France, where I first dipped my toes into the fascinating world of environmental studies. Eager to explore further, I ventured into the fields of Remote Sensing and Geo-Information Science for my first Master's degree at Wageningen University in The Netherlands. This experience was all about getting hands-on with the latest tech to understand our environment from a different perspective. I then took a bit of a detour to Montpellier SupAgro in France, where I pursued another Master's degree, this time focusing on International Land Management. It was an amazing opportunity to look at environmental issues from a global land management standpoint.

News
======
-   March 2024: Abstract accepted as an oral presentation at the[__*European Geosciences Union*](https://www.egu24.eu/) in the [Present and future global vegetation dynamics and carbon stocks from observations and models](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/session/49947) session. I will talk about the covariation between forest age shifts and the net carbon balance. The abstract can be found [here](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-3888.html).
