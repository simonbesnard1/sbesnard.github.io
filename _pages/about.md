I am Simon Besnard, a senior researcher at the [GFZ Helmholtz Centre Potsdam](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/sektion/fernerkundung-und-geoinformatik/themen/global-land-monitoring). I received my PhD from [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/wageningen-university.html) and the [Max Planck Insitute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en), where I was working in the [Laboratory of Geo-information Science and Remote Sensing](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/laboratory-of-geo-information-science-and-remote-sensing.htm) and the [Model Data Integration (MDI) group](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en/bgi/mdi) under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Herold](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/martin.herold/sec14) and [Dr. Nuno Carvalhais](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZVPwSIAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research**\
I aim to understand better the past, current, and future dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems and their feedback on environmental conditions. I have vast knowledge in developing and applying new methods to extract information from a large amount of data to understand better ecosystem functioning in an ongoing changing climate. My research aims to answer questions related to the role of climate and vegetation variation in shaping biogeochemical cycles. I currently focus on understanding the dynamics of forest structure changes during the last decade and providing evidence for the co-variation between the carbon cycle and forest dynamics. 

**Studies**\
I began my academic career with a BSc in Environmental Sciences from the University of Rennes 1 in France, sparking my interest in environmental studies. Further broadening my scope, I completed a second Master’s in International Land Management at Montpellier SupAgro in France, enriching my understanding of global ecological issues through the lens of land management. I then expanded my expertise at Wageningen University in The Netherlands, earning a Master’s in Remote Sensing and Geo-Information Science, gaining proficiency in Earth Observation data and data-driven modelling framework.
