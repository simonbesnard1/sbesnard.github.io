My name is Simon Besnard and I am a senior researcher at the[__GFZ Helmholtz Centre Potsdam](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/sektion/fernerkundung-und-geoinformatik/themen/global-land-monitoring).
I received my PhD from[  Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/wageningen-university.html) and the[  Max Planck Insitute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en), where I was working in the[  Laboratory of Geo-information Science and Remote Sensing](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/laboratory-of-geo-information-science-and-remote-sensing.htm) and the[  Model Data Integration (MDI) group](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en/bgi/mdi) under the supervision of[Prof. Martin Herold](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/martin.herold/sec14) and[  Dr. Nuno Carvalhais](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZVPwSIAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research**\
My research interests are computer vision, machine learning, remote sensing, and developing new methods to support environmental sciences. My [PhD research](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/554994) focused on advancing how we measure forest structure at global scales using publicly available satellite data. My interests also include uncertainty estimation in deep learning, anomaly detection, and learning from imbalanced data, as these are omnipresent challenges that arise when working on real-world problems. I see great potential in applying machine learning to address global environmental issues. 

**Studies**\
During my Bachelor's degree in Geomatics and Planning at ETH Zurich, I discovered my fascination for machine learning and computer vision in the context of geospatial data science. Before continuing with my [Master's in Geomatics at ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/architecture-and-civil-engineering/geomatics.html), I started an internship in computer vision at [upicto](https://www.venturelab.swiss/Logitech-buys-ETH-spinoff-Upicto), a start-up from the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH. I continued it at Logitech, as Upicto was acquired during my time there.

**Collaborations**\
Following the work started during an early academic visit to [Prof. Pietro Perona's](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Perona.html)  [Computational Vision Lab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, I worked on deep learning approaches to monitor urban trees from street-level images. During my PhD, I've had the chance to collaborate with the [NASA GEDI mission](https://gedi.umd.edu/), the [Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL](http://www.wsl.ch), as well as with companies and institutions outside academia: [Barry Callebaut](https://www.barry-callebaut.com/), [High carbon stock Approach (HCSA)](http://highcarbonstock.org/), [Hunziker, Zarn und Partner (HZP)](https://www.hzp.ch/), and [MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/research-and-cooperation/research-and-development.html).

**Leisure**\
I enjoy spending my free time outdoors hiking and snowboarding, playing volleyball, and traveling where [windy](https://www.windy.com/) takes me kitesurfing. I play the drums and like making music with others.
